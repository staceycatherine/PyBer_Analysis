# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
For this project, we were asked to analyze all the ridehsare data from January to early May of 2019. The CEO asked to see compelling visualization included in the analysis. For the visualization, we decided to use Matplotlib to create different types of plots to best display the results. 

## Results
We noticed that the urban cities have the highest number of drivers and the lowest fares. The situation in the rural cities is the opposite, they have the fewest number of drivers and the highest fares. This is easily seen in the charts below.

The fare per driver is more than three times higher in rural cities than urban cities, maybe related to the distance of the rides and the lack of drivers in the area.

## Summary
The line chart below displays a summary of our findings.

From this chart, we can see that the data in all three city types show similar patterns with increasing fares in late February. Rural and urban cities show a jump in fares in the beginning of April while suburban cities show a slight downward trend. Some additional analysis could help us identify the reason behind this trend, perhaps school vacations, more people visiting rural and urban cities resulting in fewer people in the suburban cities. I would recommend further analysis on these results and suggest increasing the number of drivers in those areas during the popular drive time to even the cost of the rides.
